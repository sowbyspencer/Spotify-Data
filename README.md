# Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to further my learning as a software engineer. It allows users to analyze their liked songs on Spotify by fetching data from the Spotify Web API and performing various analyses on song features such as danceability, energy, and key. The application provides insights into the user's music preferences and explores data analysis and visualization techniques in a real-world context.

The data set being analyzed consists of the user's liked songs on Spotify, which includes information such as the song title, artist, album, and various audio features like tempo, key, and danceability. This data is obtained using the Spotify Web API, which provides a rich set of endpoints for accessing music data.

The purpose of this software is to gain practical experience with data analysis and visualization in a web development environment. By analyzing and visualizing data from a popular music streaming service, I aim to understand patterns and trends in my music preferences and explore the capabilities of modern web technologies in handling and presenting data.

# Data Analysis Results

The analysis results include distributions of various song features such as danceability, energy, duration, key, mode, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and time signature. These distributions help in understanding the characteristics of the user's liked songs.

# Development Environment

The web application is developed using Flask, a micro web framework written in Python. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with jQuery and DataTables for interactive tables. The data analysis and visualization are performed using Pandas and Matplotlib.
